# StreamGL

[![Build Status](http://deploy.graphistry.com/buildStatus/icon?job=StreamGL)](http://deploy.graphistry.com/job/StreamGL/)

Stream WebGL buffers into the browser from a remote server


## Build

Requires node `v0.10.41` and npm `v2.14.0`.

- `npm run build` compiles for production
- `npm run build-dev` compiles for development
- `npm run start` compiles for production and starts a file watcher
- `npm run start-dev` compiles for development and starts a file watcher
- `npm run dev` is an alias for `npm run start-dev`

None of these scripts use live-reload or hot-module-reloading, so your app state will stay safe until you refresh.
